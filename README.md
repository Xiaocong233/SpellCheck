# SpellCheck
This is my program created for pset5, cs50x. Presumably, it checks for "mispelled" words by iterating through an input of text file and trying to match the words extracted from the input file with a user input of dictionary (optional, if no input then program turns to use the default dictionary).

Run with "./speller [dictionary] text"

This by far the hardest programming task I've been assigned and accomplished, spending about 7 hours to finish. It combined most if not all accumulated tools and theories taught in the online lecture, making people have to understand them beyond a shallow level in order to utilize them to fulfill the pset's requirement. After toils and headaches I eventually pushed through!! Don't give up now.
